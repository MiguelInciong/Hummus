        Quick hummus recipe This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.
It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.
It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads

<p><em>Hummus</em>, that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food. It deserves it. All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right.
It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and <strong>olive oil in most traditional versions.</strong>
